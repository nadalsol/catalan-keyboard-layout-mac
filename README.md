Wishing to stare at the Catalan flag, but still need to type with different keyboard character sets? Then just copy the `.keylayout` and `.icns` file into `/Library/Keyboard\ Layouts/` on your Mac! You probably need to reboot and then you may choose the layout under "System Preferences > Keyboard > Input Sources".
